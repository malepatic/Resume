📌 Tools:
	•	Compiled using MacTeX on macOS or directly on Overleaf for quick editing
	•	Designed with minimal LaTeX dependencies for compatibility

⚙️ Steps I Follow:
	1.	Edit main.tex – I update it with recent projects (e.g., CVE Analytics System using Kubernetes, Kafka, and LLMs).
	2.	Build PDF – I compile locally with pdflatex main.tex or on Overleaf.
	3.	Apply – I submit it for roles focused on backend systems, cloud platforms, or infrastructure automation.
